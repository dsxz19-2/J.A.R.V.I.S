# J.A.R.V.I.S
This J.A.R.V.I.S is made using the Gemini API. It will be made to mimic Jarvis from the Ironman movies. It will be able to understand human speech and respond with intelligent answers to your questions with many more features yet to come. 
I am making this project specifically to fit my needs as I work, so some of its features may be too niche for others, such as the 3D rendering part (coming soon) or the circuit design element (also coming soon). 

## Visualizer 
The visualizer is purely for aesthetic purposes and will help show when you or Jarvis are speaking. Version 1 uses **pygame** to make a window with a few arcs on it that change length depending on when the sound is detected. Probably will be changed to something else because it it doesn't look too great

## Visualizer Update
The visualizer has been updated. It now uses OpenGL in Python to make better faster and better visuals.

You shadertoy.com to find other shaders and paste them into shader.py where the original fragment_shader_code is.
